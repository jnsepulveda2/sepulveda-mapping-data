# Exercise: Saving a Filtered DataFrame of Wines

For this exercise, a dataset of wines was used. The data contains information about the name, grape, region, variety, rating, and notes of 780 wines. The goal was to filter this dataset to obtain only **white wines from California with a rating higher than 90**.

The exercise involved the following steps:
1. Loading the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
2. Filtering the wines according to the specified criteria.
3. Serializing the filtered data to store it in a .json file.
4. Loading the data back from the .json file to ensure it was done correctly.

The Jupyter Notebook containing the exercise is `answer.ipynb`.
