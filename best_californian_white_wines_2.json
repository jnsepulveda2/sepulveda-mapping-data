A rich palate showcases refreshing flavors of melon and soft vanilla leading to an exceptionally smooth and lengthy balanced finish.", "433": "The 2017 Leese-Fitch Chardonnay hails from fruit picked at both ends of the Lodi appellation. This blend gives the wine a core of cool climate fruit with essence of lemon, apple, and pear. The Clarksburg Viognier gives the blend some additional complexity with notes of apricot and tangerine, rounding out the mouthfeel.", "435": "The 2010 Leese-Fitch Sauvignon Blanc is a crisp and refreshing wine. This wine has a high-tone citrus zest aroma with minerality reminiscent of a brisk ocean breeze. There's a hint of freshly squeezed grapefruit juice and tropical Pina Colada. The palate is zippy and alive with Lemon grass spice, but balanced with a touch of creamy tapioca to round out the mid-palate. "}}
